Typescript is super set of javascript.

now javascript is dynamically typed where as typescript is statically typed thats where the name comes from.

//primitive numbers, string boolean
//Complex types are arrays and objects

//Primitive

let age:number;
age=12;

also we can write this as let age:number =12
both types are allowed in type script.


the type starts with lower case so that it identifies as type but if it tarts with upper case it will be taken as objects

let name: string;
name='Ayuh'

let isStudent :boolean;
isStudent =true;

========

// Complex types

let hobbies :string[] //array of strings

now we can declare a str8ings like

hobbies =['ayush',''man']

let person:any;

person ={
    name :'Max',
    age:32
}
if you write 

person ={
    isStudent=true;
}

in this instance its allowed because we have written person :any which will allow any types of objects to form.

set a type of the variable- type assignment, we are defining the structure of the objects.

let people :{
    name: string,
    age:number
}

if want to makearray of objects then

let people :{
    name: string,
    age:number
}[];
